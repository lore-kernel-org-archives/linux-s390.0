Well, it's not clear that we _will_ need it to be so special. You could
perhaps argue that it's overengineering. It's just that at the time I
did it, I _thought_ I'd need it for ppoll().

It's only in later optimisations that I realised we only ever really
needed to use TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK in the case where ppoll() or pselect()
was interrupted.
