I think that this method looks cleaner than the version with the
conditionals and enum.

My first preference though would be to document that the current code
doesn't provide the acquire semantics. The thinking is that if OSQ is
just used internally as a queuing mechanism and isn't used as a
traditional lock guarding critical sections, then it may just be
misleading and just adds more complexity.

If we do want a separate acquire and relaxed variants, then I think
David's version using macros is a bit more in line with other locking
code.
