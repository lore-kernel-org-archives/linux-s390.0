IIRC, I think I made the suggestion to always save the elf fields
because otherwise it was looking like we were going to need a lot of
spaghetti code.

But if we can find a way to wrap the elf fields in LIVEPATCH while
keeping the code simple, then there's no real downside and I think
that's the way to go.  If somebody else wants to use the fields later,
then they can remove or change the ifdefs as needed.
