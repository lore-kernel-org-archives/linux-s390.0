Yes, sorry for this mistake, it should be bugfix for smc.

Hi Alexandra,

Except for the issue with the barrier, which was feedback from the 
review, all other issues have actually occurred in our environment
and have been verified through internal testing. However, most of these 
issues are caused by reference leakage rather than panic, so it is 
difficult to provide a
representative phenomenon. But what you said is do necessary, so I will 
post some phenomena in the next version, such as

lsmod | grep smc
or
smcss - a

In that case, we can found  the issues of reference residue or the 
connection residue. Hope it can be helpful to you.

Thanks,
D. Wythe
