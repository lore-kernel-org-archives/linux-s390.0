There's the option of using GCC plugins now that the infrastructure was
upstreamed from grsecurity. It can be used as part of the regular build
process and as long as the analysis is pretty simple it shouldn't hurt
compile time much.

The problem with doing that is I don't think there are people with much
experience with GCC contributing upstream and it's going to be more work
to develop/maintain than some kind of specialized DSL for analysis. I
think a few static analysis plugins are used as part of maintaining
grsecurity for solving issues like finding false positives for the
REFCOUNT overflow checking feature, so it's something that's already
being done in practice elsewhere.
