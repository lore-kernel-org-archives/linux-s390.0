Yeah, the risk for "corrupted addr_limit" is mainly a concern for
archs with addr_limit on the kernel stack. If I'm reading things
correctly, that means, from the archs I've been paying closer
attention to, it's an issue for arm, mips, and powerpc:

arch/arm/include/asm/uaccess.h: current_thread_info()->addr_limit = fs;
arch/arm/include/asm/thread_info.h:             (current_stack_pointer
& ~(THREAD_SIZE - 1));

arch/mips/include/asm/uaccess.h:#define set_fs(x)
(current_thread_info()->addr_limit = (x))
arch/mips/kernel/process.c:        * task stacks at THREAD_SIZE - 32

arch/powerpc/include/asm/uaccess.h:#define set_fs(val)
(current->thread.fs = (val))
arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c:          struct pt_regs *regs =
task_stack_page(current) + THREAD_SIZE;

(s390 uses a register, x86 and arm64 implement THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK.)
Targeting addr_limit through arbitrary write attacks isn't too common
since ... it's an arbitrary write. The issue with addr_limit was that
it can live on the kernel stack, which meant all kinds of
stack-related bugs can lead to it getting stomped on.

So, two goals to protect addr_limit:

- get it off the stack to make the difficulty of corruption on par
with other sensitive things that would require an arbitrary write
flaw.

- detect/block unbalanced set_fs() calls.

If we can get the former addressed by the remaining architectures,
then that class of attack will go away. For the latter, it sounds like
Linus's slowpath-exit will work nicely.

To me it looks like he architectures with addr_limit still on the
stack would still benefit from always-check-addr_limit on syscall
exit, but that would be arch-specific anyway.

And then, of course, we've got the parallel task of just removing
set_fs() entirely. :)
