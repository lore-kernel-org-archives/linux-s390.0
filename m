A reader only benchmark will not go into the slow path at all. It is 
only when there is a mix of readers and writers will the reader slowpath 
be executed.

I think there will be a little bit of performance impact for a workload 
that produce just the right amount of rwsem contentions. However, it is 
hard to produce a microbenchmark to create such a right amount of 
contention. As the amount of contention increases, I believe this patch 
will help performance instead of hurting it. Even then, the amount of 
performance degradation in that particular case will be pretty small.
