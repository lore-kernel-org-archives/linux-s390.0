I guess I don't see why rlimit makes any sense, though.  It's not a
resource utilization control, hard vs soft limits make very little
sense, requiring capabilities to exceed the hard limit doesn't help
anything, and it's only useful to preserve it across execve() to work
around bugs.

So if it's going to be a number, let's just make it be a new number
with a new API to control it.
