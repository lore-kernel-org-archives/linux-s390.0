Thanks Miroslav! I'll do that.

Ah, thanks for catching that. I will also try testing the patchset on
s390x and report back.

I admit I'm a bit confused by the comment, I can't seem to find where
core_symtab and core_strtab are purportedly discarded after module
init (perhaps I'm missing something?). IMO it sounds more like it's
describing mod->symtab and mod->strtab instead, because these are in
module init memory and are freed later. In any case, my reason for using
core_symtab is that the original symbol table (mod->symtab) is marked
with INIT_OFFSET_MASK in layout_symtab() (see kernel/module.c), and is
therefore in init memory. This memory is freed near the end of
do_init_module() with do_free_init(). Since core_symtab is in module core
memory, for livepatch modules I simply used core_symtab to hold a
full copy of the symbol table instead of the slimmed down version that
it was originally intended to hold.

Alternatively, we can tweak layout_symtab() to *not* mark the symtab
with INIT_OFFSET_MASK and put it in core memory instead. I think
either way will work, but maybe it is cleaner to do it this way
instead.
