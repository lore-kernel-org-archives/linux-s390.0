You're right, statistics are treated independently so what you describe 
is currently not supported.

In KVM the utilization is more qualitative, so there isn't such problem.
But as long as the interface is based on file access, the possibility of 
snapshotting might not be useful; however, it could still be considered 
to be added later together with the binary access.

Jonathan, how is your metricfs handling this case?

Thank you,
Emanuele
