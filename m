I agree with David, the OSQ is meant to be used internally as a
queuing mechanism than as something for protecting critical regions,
and so these guarantees of preventing critical section leaks don't
seem to be necessary for the OSQ. If that is the case, then it would
be better to avoid the performance hit to mutexes and rwsems.
