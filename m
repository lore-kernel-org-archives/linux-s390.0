When the count value is in between 0 and RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS, there
are 2 possibilities. Either a writer is present and there is no
waiter or there are waiters and readers. There is no easy way to
know which is true unless the wait_lock is taken.

This patch changes the RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS from 0xffff (32-bit) or
0xffffffff (64-bit) to 0xc0000000 (32-bit) or 0xc000000000000000
(64-bit). By doing so, we will be able to determine if writers
are present by looking at the count value alone without taking the
wait_lock.

This patch has the effect of halving the maximum number of writers
that can attempt to take the write lock simultaneously. However,
even the reduced maximum of about 16k (32-bit) or 1G (64-bit) should
be more than enough for the foreseeable future.

With that change, the following identity is now no longer true:

  RWSEM_ACTIVE_WRITE_BIAS = RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS + RWSEM_ACTIVE_READ_BIAS
