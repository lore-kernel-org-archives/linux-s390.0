Right, that's true at the moment for parisc as well.
I do have unfinished patches which will add runtime kernel patching
for ftrace to parisc, and those patches will need to add code to 
enable/disable ro text/data like x86.

I never tried the option itself, but it should work on parisc to disable
the ro protection by this option.

I'd be fine with a rename of the config option to ARCH_HAS_HARDENED_MAPPINGS
and keeping the "rodata=" command line.
