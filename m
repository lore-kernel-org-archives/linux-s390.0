Yes, I am OK with your change. However, I need some additional changes 
in osq_wait_next() as well. Either it is changed to use the release 
variants of atomic_cmpxchg and xchg or using macro like what you did 
with osq_lock and osq_unlock. The release variant is needed in the 
osq_lock(). As osq_wait_next() is only invoked in the failure path of 
osq_lock(), the barrier type doesn't really matter.
