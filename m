Hi,

I had just run the rwsem microbenchmark on a 1-socket 44-core Qualcomm
Amberwing (Centriq 2400) arm64 system. There were 18 writer and 18
reader threads running.

For the patched kernel, the results were:

It is obvious that for arm64, the writers are preferred under all
circumstances. One special thing about the results was that for the
all writers case, the number of slowpath calls were exceedingly small.
It was about 1000 or less which are significantly less than in x86-64
which was in the millions. Maybe it was due to the LL/SC architecture
that allows it to stay in the fast path as much as possible with
homogenous operation.

The corresponding results for the unpatched kernel were:
