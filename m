(Apologies, my SMTP server was set up incorrectly so this didn't get
sent out when I thought it did)

Okay, that's useful to know. I think I'm going to add a
'select HARDENED_MAPPINGS' (or whatever it gets changed to) to arches
that were previously def_bool. This is a slight Kconfig semantic change
but as has been pointed out we now have the command line option.
