That's wrong. DAX is a per-inode flag, not a mount wide flag. This
needs to be done once the inode has been fully initialised and
IS_DAX(inode) can be run.

Also, the benchmark doesn't show that all these locks are being
tested by this benchmark. e.g. the i_mmaplock isn't involved in
the benchmark's IO paths at all. It's only taken in page faults and
truncate paths....

I'd also like to see how much of the gain comes from the iolock vs
the ilock, as the ilock is nested inside the iolock and so
contention is much rarer....

As it is, I'm *extremely* paranoid when it comes to changes to core
locking like this. Performance is secondary to correctness, and we
need much more than just a few benchmarks to verify there aren't
locking bugs being introduced....

Cheers,

Dave.
