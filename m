This patch has now been superseded by a second one where changes to the 
xfs code is no longer needed. The new patch will enable reader spinning 
for all rwsem and dynamically disable it depending on past history.

The core rwsem locking logic hasn't been changed. There are some minor 
changes, however, on what RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS value to use that requires 
more eyeballs to make sure that it hasn't introduced any new bug.
