Thanks for the patch.

I will assume that the s390 specifics are correct...

ckpt-v13 already has these two fixed.

If we add a field to 'struct cr_hdr_head', then we'll need arch-dependent
code in a non-arch dependent source, to ensure that no two architectures
choose the same value as an identifier.

Can we not use the 'machine' string fiels in 'struct cr_hdr_head' - and
then additional classification can take place in cr_read/write_head_arch() ?

This header file will be included from user space, e.g. by a utility to
convert image format between kernel versions. For that, and for 32/64
bit compatibility (while shouldn't be an issue with s390...), please
substitue:   '__u64' for 'unsigned long', etc, and avoid including an
entire structure as is.

Probably unrelated ?

Thanks,

Oren.
