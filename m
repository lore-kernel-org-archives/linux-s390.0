Which is a bit of a problem for us, because we often use the write
locks as an IO barrier for operations like truncate, fallocate, etc.
i.e. we want it to immediately block readers.

That's going to be a bit of a problem if, for example, we have so
many AIO-based direct IO writers on a file we can't get fallocate to
run in a timely fashion to preallocate the space the writers are
soon going to write into.

Not to mention the AIO-DIO append case where we have multiple
concurrent writers at EOF, and so every so often one of the many IOs
needs to take the write lock extending EOF safely. Blocking that for
10ms waiting for a hand-off is going to make all the people who care
about deterministic IO latency go nuts....

So from my perspective on the IO side, I'd much prefer a write bias.
Indeed, if we go back to the Irix XFS code, all these locks we
defined as "MR_BARRIER" locks, which meant the XFS rwsems were
specifically intended to have writer bias.

I think we can live with a fair r/w bias, but swinging from a
50:1 write bias to a 100:1 read bias is going change behaviour
dramatically, and in many cases it won't be an improvement...

Cheers,

Dave.
