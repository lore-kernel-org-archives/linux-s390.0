Great!

Was a Coccinelle script used for any of these conversions? I wonder if
it'd be easier to do a single treewide patch for the more mechanical
changes.

And, actually, I still think the "prepare" patches should just be
collapsed into the actual "covert" patches -- there are only a few.

After those, yeah, I think getting these sent to their respective
maintainers is the next step.

Sure! I will add it to the tracker. Here's for the refactoring:
https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/30

and here's for the removal:
https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/94

if you can added details/examples of how they should be removed, that'd
help other folks too, if they wanted to jump in. :)
