That would be a larger change.  As I understand it (and I may misunderstand
it), I would need to rename all the clear_bit(), __clear_bit(), change_bit(),
... functions to have an 'arch_' prefix and then include instrumented-lock.h

Well, s390 already uses instrumented-lock.h so I followed along with
what they're doing.  I don't think instrumented-lock.h is used at all on
these other architectures, but the whole bitops header files are such a
mess that I could easily have built a completely wrong mental model of
what's going on.
