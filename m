OK,

But can we turn what you call "nmi_safe_t" into "local_atomic_t" then ?
Because we have to specify that this type must only be used as part of
per-cpu data with preemption disabled, and we also specify that it is
atomic.

Plus, nmi_safe_t does not make much sense on architectures without NMIs,
where we sometimes disable interrupts to make the modification "atomic"
wrt all other interrupts that can happen.
