OK, so could you be more specific? Distributions have no clue about
which HW their kernel runs on so how can they possibly make a sensible
decision here?

They have notifications for udev to online that memory and AFAICU
neither KVM nor VMware are using memory hotplut for ballooning - unlike
HyperV and Xen.

Why?

I would argue because this really depends on the usecase. a) somebody
might want to online memory as movable and that really depends on which
node we are talking about because not all of them can be movable b) it
is easier to handle potential errors from userspace than the kernel.

and that is why we do not want to hardwire this into the kernel and we
have a notification to handle this in userspace.

you cannot preallocate for all the possible memory that can be added.
