Got any commit ID of that bug - was it because a function executed by the 
interrupt handler leaked KERNEL_DS?

That doesn't really _solve_ the performance concerns, it just forces most people 
to enable it by creating a 'security or performance' false dichotomy ...

No, it does not make it unexploitable, it could still be exploitable if the 
runtime check is buggy or if there's kernel execution outside of the regular 
system call paths - there's plenty of such hardware functionality on x86 for 
example.

Thanks,
