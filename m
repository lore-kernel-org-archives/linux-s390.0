Yes I understand how this made the implementation simpler. I was
questioning how this made user management any easier. Changing
valid zones which races with the hotplug consumer (e.g. udev) sounds
like a terrible idea to me.

Anyway, it seems that the initial assumption/restriction that all
pages have to start on the zone Normal is not really needed. I have a
preliminary patch which removes that and associates newly added pages
with a zone at the online time and it seems to be working reasonably
well. I have to iron out some corners before I post it.
