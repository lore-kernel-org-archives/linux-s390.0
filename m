Will it cause problems that now f2fs encryption can be "enabled" without
F2FS_FS_XATTR, and ubifs encryption without UBIFS_FS_XATTR && BLOCK?

Otherwise I think this patch looks fine.  I'm a bit concerned about the bloat
from making FS_ENCRYPTION non-modular, but given that it will make sharing I/O
code much easier, it's probably worthwhile.

It would help to strip down the dependencies of FS_ENCRYPTION to just the stuff
needed for just AES-256-XTS and AES-256-CTS.  I already sent out a patch a
couple months ago (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10589319/) to remove
CONFIG_CTR which isn't used at all; I'll remind Ted to apply that.  But we could
also drop CONFIG_SHA256, which is only needed for AES-128-CBC contents
encryption.  If we do that, it should be a separate patch, though.

Thanks,

- Eric
