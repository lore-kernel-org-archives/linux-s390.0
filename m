Sure, easy change.

I am fine with the write_spin name.

The loopcnt does not include time spinning on writer. It will be 
decremented only if the lock is owned by reader (can_spin == false). I 
will clarify that with additional comments.

Sure.

Will clarify the comment.

I will fix the coding style problem.
