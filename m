The change on the unlock side is more for documentation purpose than is 
actually needed. As you had said, the xchg() call has provided the 
necessary memory barrier. Using the _release variant, however, may have 
some performance benefit in some architectures.

BTW, osq_lock/osq_unlock aren't general purpose locking primitives. So 
there is some leeways on how fancy we want on the lock and unlock sides.
