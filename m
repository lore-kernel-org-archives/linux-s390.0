I think it just says that core_* symbols are used as temporary tables 
during module loading. They are not discarded anywhere but they could be 
(and maybe they'll be in the future). So it is better not to depend on 
them.

But both mod->symtab and mod->strtab are changed to point to their core_ 
versions right before do_free_init is called in do_init_module. So they 
should be the same. My remark was more of an academic question. I believe 
it is not a functional thing, just the matter of taste. But maybe I am 
missing something.

Yeah, I wouldn't do this. core_* symbols are ok from functional point of 
view.

Thanks,
