Right, I didn't mean to suggest that vulnerability would be fixed by
this solution. I was trying to show how there can be some pretty
complex interaction with exceptions/interrupts/etc that would make
pure static analysis still miss things.

Right, but this "slippery slope" argument isn't the best way to reject
security changes. Let me take a step back and describe the threat, and
where we should likely spend time:

The primary threat with addr_limit getting changed is that a
narrowly-scoped attack (traditionally stack exhaustion or
adjacent-stack large-index writes) could be leveraged into opening the
entire kernel to writes (by allowing all syscalls with a
copy_to_user() call to suddenly be able to write to kernel memory).
So, really, the flaw is having addr_limit at all. Removing set_fs()
should, I think, allow this to become a const (or at least should get
us a lot closer).

The main path to corrupting addr_limit has been via stack corruption.
On architectures with CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, this risk is greatly
reduced already, but it's not universally available yet. (And as long
as we're talking about stack attacks, CONFIG_VMAP_STACK makes
cross-stack overflows go away, and cross-stack indexing harder, but
that's not really about addr_limit since currently nothing with
VMAP_STACK doesn't already have THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK.)

So, left with a still exploitable target in memory that allows such an
expansion of attack method, I still think it's worth keeping this
patch series, but if we can drop set_fs() I could probably be
convinced the benefit of the series doesn't exceed the cost on
THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK-architectures (x86, arm64, s390). But that means
at least currently keeping it on arm, for example. If we can make
addr_limit const, well, we don't need the series at all.
