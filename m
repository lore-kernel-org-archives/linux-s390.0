First, thanks for the comments. I think my only real gripe is that, in the
pseudo code I provided, we are not only doing the for loop for each object, but
also a bunch of kmalloc's/kstrdup's and kfree's just to be able to check if
this klp section belongs to the current object, *and* also kmallocing/kfreeing
just to provide buffers to extract parts of a symbol's name. In the patch
module code, each klp section was parsed just once and sorted by object:
https://github.com/flaming-toast/kpatch/blob/no_dynrela_redux/kmod/patch/livepatch-patch-hook.c#L213
^^^ This was before we decided to get rid of 'external', so only klp sections
had to be parsed. In v3, we are also looking to parse the symbol name (to
eliminate 'external'), so now I'm just trying to reduce all the string stuff to
the bare minimum needed to have this work.

function klp_write_object_relocations(..,struct klp_object *obj,..) {
   for each section in mod->sechdrs { // iterate through all elf sections, no more obj->reloc_secs list
       if not a klp rela section
           continue;
->     sec_objname = extract_objname_from_section(section);  // .klp.rela.[objname].sectionname
->     if (strcmp(sec_objname, obj->name)) { // this klp rela section doesn't belong to this object
->         kfree(sec_objname);
->         continue;
       }

     for each rela in this klp rela section {
        sym = symtab + ELF_R_SYM(rela->r_info);
->      sym_objname = extract_objname_from_symbol(sym) // symname.klp.[objname]
->      if (!sym_objname)
->           goto handle_error; // calls kfree(sec_objname);
->      symname = extract_symname_from_symbol(sym); // [symname].klp.objname
->      if (!symname)
->          goto handle_error; // calls kfree(sec_objname);
        ret = klp_find_object_symbol(sym_objname, symname, &addr)
        if (ret)
->          goto handle_error2; // calls kfree(symname), then kfree(sec_objname)
        sym->st_value = addr;
->      if (sym_objname) // free buffers before proceeding to next iteration of loop
->         kfree(sym_objname);
->      kfree(symname);
     }
[ snipped rest of function ]

I'm trying to figure out a way to simplify all the lines marked with '->', and
make this code as readable and palatable as possible. I think primarily the
kfree's and multiple error-handling goto's bothered me, which is why I
suggested putting the symname.klp.[objname] part in .kpatch.strings and using
those masks I suggested. Then we wouldn't even need to set-up temporary buffers to
hold the sym_objname + symname strings. You're right that this would require
another assumption about the patch module, but I think having the names of
livepatch symbols formatted as 'symname.klp.objname' was already another
assumption, and using .kpatch.strings would just be changing this assumption.

Correct, in the v2 discussion we decided symbol names can have the
names of their objects attached, which will eliminate the need for the
external flag and klp_find_external_symbol().

Since we are removing 'external', we decided to append the objname to the
symbol name. But then extra string parsing is needed to get the real symbol
name. So, pmod->core_strtab + sym->st_name would correspond to the full name,
formatted as 'symname.klp.objname'. We parse to get the real symname and the
objname. Then we no longer need the klp_find_external_symbol() call, it'd just
be one call to klp_find_object_symbol(sym_objname, symname, addr)

I think 'external' is kpatch-specific (correct me if  I'm wrong), as I
explained above we're trying to get rid of it.

Right, OK. I agree that this work has to be done somewhere, I am just hesitant
about the new string handling code, as I pointed out above. If people are OK and
agree that this is the better approach, then I will keep it.

Thanks again,
Jessica
