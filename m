That does sound more robust to me. And at least on systems that don't
compile out the BPF interpreter, everything should be more or less
fine then...

I imagine that one extra pointer in there - pointing to your struct
mod_alloc_user - would probably not be terrible. 8 bytes more per
kernel stack shouldn't be so bad?
