Hi David,

IMO the important part for now is having a flexible kernel API for
exposing statistics across multiple subsystems, so that they can be
harvested in an efficient way.  The userspace API is secondary, and
multiple APIs can be added to cater for different usecases.

For example, as of the first five patches the memory usage is the same
as what is now in the mainline kernel, since all the patchset does is
take existing debugfs inodes and move them to statsfs.  I agree that, if
the concept is extended to the whole kernel, scalability and memory
usage becomes an issue; and indeed, the long-term plan is to support a
binary format that is actually _more_ efficient than the status quo for
large scale systems.

In the meanwhile, the new filesystem can be disabled (see the difference
between "STATS_FS" and "STATS_FS_API") if it imposes undesirable overhead.

Thanks,

Paolo
