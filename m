Yes, of course. Why is that unexpected? You could just as easily make
the xchg_release an smp_store_release and this would still be permitted,
that's the whole point of acquire/release -- they're semi-permeable
barriers that allow accesses outside of the critical section to leak in,
but not the other way around.

It's worth noting that you've omitted the control dependency from
xchg_release to the subsequent write in your litmus tests, but I don't
think that actually changes anything here.
