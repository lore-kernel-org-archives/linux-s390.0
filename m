I am going to change it to use smp_acquire__after_ctrl_dep() as 
suggested by PeterZ. Is that a good enough compromise? I have also 
changed the xchg in the unlock side to xchg_release which could help 
performance in some archs. The thing is when developers see the name 
osq_lock/osq_unlock, they will naturally assume the proper barrriers are 
provided which is not currently the case.

Anyway, the change won't affect x86, it is probably ARM or PPC that may 
have an impact.

Cheers,
Longman
