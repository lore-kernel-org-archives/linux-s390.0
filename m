Good point.

Still I think I want all the trace sorting blkparse does for me.
I didn't want to reimplement that functionality.

I don't need other capabilities of blkparse, though, like generating
some basic statistics.

Perhaps, it would make sense to move some blkparse code to a separate
c-file, which could be linked by other tools in the package, blkiomon?

Would be fine with me to make this all as light-weight as possible, e.g.
get rid of blkparse and a pipe.
