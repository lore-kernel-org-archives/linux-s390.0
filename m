Hi Dave,

I really do apologize if these caused undue traffic on vger.  It
certainly wasn't our intention to cause any problems.

We've had a fear all along that we'll just go back into our little
containers@lists.linux-foundation.org, and go astray of what the
community wants done with these patches.  It's also important to
remember that these really do affect the entire kernel.  Unfortunately,
it's not really a single feature or something that fits well on any
other mailing list.  It has implications _everywhere_.  I think Andrew
Morton also asked that these continue coming to LKML, although his
request probably came at a time when the set was a wee bit smaller.

I honestly don't expect people to be reading the whole thing at once.
But, I do hope that people can take a look at their individual bits that
are touched.

I know these patches are certainly not at the level of importance as,
say the pata or -stable updates, but they're certainly not of
unprecedented scale.  I've seen a number of patchbombs of this size
recently.

I hope Andrew pulls this set into -mm so this doesn't even come up
again.  But, if it does, can you make some suggestions on how to be more
kind to vger in the process?
