The reason I included it in the MVP was that without it I was seeing high lock
contention for the split queue lock, which was significantly eating the
performance gains. But since then Yin Fengwei's patch to make this more
efficient has been accepted so perhaps that solves the problem and in that case
we can drop this as you suggest. If I still see a reasonable perf improvement
without it, I'll drop for v2.
