On arm64, we split down to page granularity if needed, but use the
largest possible mapping we can (e.g. if we can use a 2M block, we do).

Because of the way we freed the init area, we already couldn't use
larger mappings anyway. Applying the strict permissions didn't come at a
measureable overhead in any real testing.

I also don't see much point in describing some hypothetical architecture
specific overhead here. In most cases this can't be turned off (so there
isn't anything to comapre it to, and hence no cost). Where people want
to turn it off, they already know why they wish to do so.

Thanks,
Mark.
