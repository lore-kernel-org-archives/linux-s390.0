You seem to be missing the point.

{READ,WRITE}_ONCE accesses appearing in program order after a release
are not externally ordered with respect to the release unless they
access the same location.

This is illustrated by Boqun's example, which shows two WRITE_ONCE
accesses being reordered before a store-release forming the write
component of an xchg_release. In both cases, WRITE_ONCE(x, 1) remains
ordered before the store-release.
