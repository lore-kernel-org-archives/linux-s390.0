Yeah I know.. :-)

Not classical PI; there's one of those in -rt btw:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-rt-devel.git/tree/kernel/locking/rwsem-rt.c?h=linux-4.11.y-rt

I'm implementing proxy-execution (or rather, playing with it in a few
spare moments here and there). But yes, it will only be able to boost
write owners. But in order to make that happen I need the lock state and
owner thing in the same field, like mutex.


In any case, I'll try and have a look at these patches.
