This is so screwed up it's not even funny.

A 64-bit big-endian compat calls rt_sigqueueinfo.  It passes in (among
other things) a sigval_t.  The kernel can choose to interpret it as a
pointer (call it p) or an integer (call it i).  Then (unsigned long)p
= (i<<32) | [something].  If the number was an integer to begin with
*and* user code zeroed out the mess first, then [something] will be 0.
Regardless, p != i unless they're both zero.

If the result gets delivered to a signalfd, then it's plausible that
everything could work.  If it gets delivered to a 64-bit siginfo, then
all is well because it's in exactly the same screwed up state it was
in when the signal gets sent.

If, however, it's delivered to a compat task, wtf is the kernel
supposed to do?  We're effectively supposed to convert a 64-bit
sigval_t to a 32-bit sigval_t.  On a little-endian architecture, we
can fudge it because it doesn't really matter whether we consider the
pointer or the int to be authoritative.  I think that, on big-endian,
we're screwed.

BTW, x86 has its own set of screwups here.  Somehow cr2 and error_code
ended up as part of ucontext instead of siginfo, which makes
absolutely no sense to me and bloats task_struct.
