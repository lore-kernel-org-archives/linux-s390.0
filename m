Hi Jonathan, I think the remaining sticky point is this one:

In general for statsfs we took a more explicit approach where each
addend in a sum is a separate stats_fs_source.  In this version of the
patches it's also a directory, but we'll take your feedback and add both
the ability to hide directories (first) and to list values (second).

So, in the cases of interfaces and KVM objects I would prefer to keep
each addend separate.

For CPUs that however would be pretty bad.  Many subsystems might
accumulate stats percpu for performance reason, which would then be
exposed as the sum (usually).  So yeah, native handling of percpu values
makes sense.  I think it should fit naturally into the same custom
aggregation framework as hash table keys, we'll see if there's any devil
in the details.

Core kernel stats such as /proc/interrupts or /proc/stat are the
exception here, since individual per-CPU values can be vital for
debugging.  For those, creating a source per stat, possibly on-the-fly
at hotplug/hot-unplug time because NR_CPUS can be huge, would still be
my preferred way to do it.

Thanks,

Paolo
