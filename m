The rwsem has supported writer lock stealing for a long time. Reader
lock stealing isn't allowed as it may lead to writer lock starvation.
As a result, writers are preferred over readers. However, preferring
readers generally leads to better overall performance.

This patch now enables reader lock stealing on a rwsem as long as
the lock is reader-owned and optimistic spinning hasn't been disabled
because of long writer wait. This will improve overall performance
without running the risk of writer lock starvation.
