Um, I seem to have completely missed that change - when did that
happen and why?

Oh, it was part of the misguided "enable DAX on block devices"
changes - it was supposed to fix a problem with block device access
using buffered IO instead of DAX (commit 65f87ee71852 "fs, block:
force direct-I/O for dax-enabled block devices")).  The original
block device DAX code was reverted soon after this because it was
badly flawed, but this change was not removed at the same time
(probably because it was forgotton about).

Hence I'd suggest that DAX check in io_is_direct() should be removed
ASAP; the filesystems don't need it as they check the inode DAX
state directly, and the code it "fixed" is no longer in the tree.

Cheers,

Dave.
