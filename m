CONFIG_SWAP is wrong, isn't it?  It should be CONFIG_SHMEM if anything.

I'd just do

--- a/include/linux/shmem_fs.h~mm-proc-account-for-shmem-swap-in-proc-pid-smaps-fix
+++ a/include/linux/shmem_fs.h
@@ -60,11 +60,9 @@ extern struct page *shmem_read_mapping_p
 extern void shmem_truncate_range(struct inode *inode, loff_t start, loff_t end);
 extern int shmem_unuse(swp_entry_t entry, struct page *page);
 
-#ifdef CONFIG_SWAP
 extern unsigned long shmem_swap_usage(struct inode *inode);
 extern unsigned long shmem_partial_swap_usage(struct address_space *mapping,
 						pgoff_t start, pgoff_t end);
-#endif
 
 static inline struct page *shmem_read_mapping_page(
 				struct address_space *mapping, pgoff_t index)


We don't need the ifdefs around declarations and they're a pain to
maintain and they'd add a *ton* of clutter if we even tried to do this
for real.
