To hit the limit, we need to have all the threads calling down_write() 
at exactly the same instance in time which, I think, is pretty hard to 
do. Also, I don't believe you will ever see a 16k-cpu massive SMP system 
running on 32-bit kernel. I can imagine such a system running on 64-bit 
kernel, but certainly not 32-bit.
