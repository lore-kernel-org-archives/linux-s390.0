But I think comments explaining why i_mutex is not needed are
confusing and incomplete.

AFAIU RCU only helps to prevent from accessing nodes which were freed
from the radix tree. The reason why we do not need to hold i_mutex is
that the radix tree iterator would break out of the loop if we entered
node which backed truncated range. At least this is my understanding, I
might be wrong here of course.
