OK, I'll buy that.  So we split local_t into a counter and an atomic type.

OK, I've looked at how they're used, to try to figure out whether long
is the right thing.  Counters generally want to be long, but I was in doubt
about atomics; yet grep shows that atomic_long_t is quite popular.  Then
I hit struct nfs_iostats which would want a u64 and a long.  I don't think
we want local_counter_u64 etc.

Just thinking out loud, perhaps a new *type* is the wrong direction?  How
about a set of macros which take a fundamental type, such as:

	DECLARE_LOCAL_COUNTER(type, name);
	local_counter_inc(type, addr);
	...
	DECLARE_LOCAL_ATOMIC(type, name);
	local_atomic_add_return(type, addr);

This allows pointers, u32, u64, long, etc.  If a 32-bit arch can't do 64-bit
local_counter_inc easily, at least the hairy 64-bit code can be eliminated at
compile time.

Or maybe that's overdesign?
Rusty.
