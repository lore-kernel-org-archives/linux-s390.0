Could you be more specific please? Setting online_movable from the udev
rule should just work regardless of the ordering or the state of other
memblocks. If that doesn't work I would call it a bug.

yeah and that is why the patch does the onlining from the kernel.

How do you want to support usecases which really want to online memory
as movable? Do you expect those users to disable the option because
unless I am missing something the in kernel auto onlining only supporst
regular onlining.
