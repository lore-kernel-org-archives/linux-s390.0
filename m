Hi,  thanks for taking a look.  (I can definately use some help)

> Hmm, maybe you should also save/restore other elements of mm_context_t.

Oren pointed out (on Jan 15, see
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/containers/2009-January/015304.html)
that the arch-independent restart code will re-create the checkpointed
memory mappings using do_mmap_pgoff().  So the other mm_context_t
contents should be automatically handled, right?

I went ahead and added those three - but they're always all 0 on my
testcases so far, and restoring them doesn't fix my restart segfault :(

How and why are they supposed to be set though?  Looking through the
s390 arch code, I don't really see anything justifying hand-tweaking
them.

Short answer: bc martin told me to :)  But I take it I misunderstood,
and should only do that if running in kvm?
(That email at
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/containers/2009-January/015305.html)

But thinking through this:  if some task 798 is running inside kvm,
it will have already done s390_enable_sie(), right?  So if it now
does sys_restart(), we shouldn't run that again, right?

So I've removed it again.  (Which still doesn't solve my segfault on
restart.  At the moment I'm busily learning about the VM debugger :)

thanks,
