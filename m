If you look into the actual code:

         next = xchg_release(&node->next, NULL);
         if (next) {
                 WRITE_ONCE(next->locked, 1);
                 return;
         }

There is a control dependency that WRITE_ONCE() won't happen until 
xchg_release() returns. For your particular example, I will change it to

     CPU 0
     ===================
     WRITE_ONCE(x, 1);
     xchg_relaxed(&node->next, NULL);
     smp_store_release(next->locked, 1);

I don't change WRITE_ONCE to a smp_store_release() because it may not 
always execute.
