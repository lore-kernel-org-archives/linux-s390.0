Errr... everytime I need to go and read all the code from
scratch to convince myself... and I my mind just context
switched :(

Yes, that's what I was thinking. And I don't know enough of
s390 to understand why we could not.

Either that or record the state before it is modified in
dedicated checkpoint-related fields (e.g. per thread).
