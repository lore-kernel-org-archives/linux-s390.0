Roland, Linus, I'm sorry for being offtopic, but there is something
I can't understand from the very beginning, when TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK
was introduced.

Yes!

Why do we need any flag? It looks a bit ugly. Isn't it better to introduce
the new magic ERESTART_XXX which means ERESTARTNOHAND + restore-sigmask ?

We only need this flag as an implicit parameter to the arch dependent do_signal()
which we can't call directly, and thus it must imply TIF_SIGPENDING, and it
is not valid after do_signal() (should be cleared). This all looks like
ERESTART_ magic, why should we add something else ?

Of course, probably it is too late to change the implementation even if
I am right, the question is: what I am missed?

Oleg.
