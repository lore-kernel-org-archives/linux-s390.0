 Yup. The problem is that this usage count tracking doesn't exist. And
drivers could at least in theory treat CMA like vram and swap buffers
in&out of it, so just refcounting the userspace vma isn't enough. In
practice, right now, it might be enough for CMA drivers though (but
there's more that's possible here).
