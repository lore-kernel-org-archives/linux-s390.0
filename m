Thank you! This looks good. I wonder if the different handling of little
endian is worth solving -- I'm suspicious about powerpc's use of
__LITTLE_ENDIAN__ vs a CONFIG, but I guess the compiler would match the
target endian-ness. Regardless, it captures what the architectures are
doing, and gets things standardized.

I don't have compilers for these.

These I can build-test immediately.

These two are available in Ubuntu's cross compiler set, so I'll get them
added to my cross-builders.

In the meantime, I'll wait a bit to see if we can get some Acks/Reviews
from arch maintainers. :)
