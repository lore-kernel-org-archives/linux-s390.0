But why do we need these guarantees given that osq is only used internally
for lock owner spinning situations? Leaking out of the critical region will
obviously be bad if using it as a full lock, but, as is, this can only hurt
performance of two of the most popular locks in the kernel -- although yes,
using smp_acquire__after_ctrl_dep is nicer for polling.

If you need tighter osq for rwsems, could it be refactored such that mutexes
do not take a hit?

As well as for the smp_acquire__after_ctrl_dep comment you have above, this also
obviously pairs with the osq_lock's smp_load_acquire while backing out (unqueueing,
step A). Given the above, for this case we might also just rely on READ_ONCE(node->locked),
if we get the conditional wrong and miss the node becoming locked, all we do is another
iteration, and while there is a cmpxchg() there, it is mitigated with the ccas thingy.

Thanks,
