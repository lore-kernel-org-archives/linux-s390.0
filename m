Except that it's DAX, and in 4.7-rc1 that used shared locking at the
XFS level and never took exclusive locks.

*However*, the DAX IO path locking in XFS  has changed in 4.9-rc1 to
match the buffered IO single writer POSIX semantics - the test is a
bad test based on the fact it exercised a path that is under heavy
development and so can't be used as a regression test across
multiple kernels.

If you want to stress concurrent access to a single file, please
use direct IO, not DAX or buffered IO.

Cheers,

Dave.
