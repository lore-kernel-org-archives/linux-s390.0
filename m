I've triggered this bug on before at the time i've worked on
e4defrag functionality, but AFAIK all related issues was aready fixed
and 013 has nothing with e4defrag.
But still bh->b_blocknr under us. So other obvious place I suspect is
puch_hole but this also not true because 013 use fsstress
test in vegetarian mode: "-f rmdir=3D10 -f link=3D10 -f creat=3D10 -f m=
kdir=3D10
-f rename=3D30 -f stat=3D30 -f unlink=3D30 -f truncate=3D20"
So the only place I suspect is some unknown bug in extent status tree
Can you please enable ES_AGGRESSIVE_TEST and rerun xfstest.
