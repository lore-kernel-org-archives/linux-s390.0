Depends on your defintion of "we".  The DAX code has always abused the
direct I/O path, and that abuse is ingrained in the VFS path in a way that
we can't easily undo it in XFS, e.g. take a look at io_is_direct and
iocb_flags in include/linux/fs.h, which ensure that DAX I/O will always
appear as IOCB_DIRECT to the fs.  It will take some time to untagle
this, but it's on my todo list once the last file system (ext4)
untangles the DAX and direct I/O path.
