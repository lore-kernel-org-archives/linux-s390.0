How about trying to remove all of them?  If we could actually get rid
of all of them, we could drop the arch support, and we'd get faster,
simpler, shorter uaccess code throughout the kernel.

The ones in kernel/compat.c are generally garbage.  They should be
using compat_alloc_user_space().  Ditto for kernel/power/user.c.

flush_module_icache() is a potentially silly arch thing.  Does the
code in kernel/module.c that uses set_fs() actually work?

kernel/signal.c's set_fs() is laziness.

__probe_kernel_read() and __probe_kernel_write() use set_fs(), but
that usage only matters on sane arches* like s390x.  We should
arguably have a set_uaccess_address_space() or similar for this
purpose that's a nop on normal arches like x86.

fs/splice.c has some, ahem, interesting uses that have been the source
of nasty exploits in the past.  Converting them to use iov_iter
properly would be really, really nice.  Christoph, I don't suppose
you'd like to do that?

The others seem to mostly be fixable, but I haven't looked that closely.

Overall, I suspect that a big part of why mitigations like the one
being discussed in this thread were developed is because addr_limit
used to be on the stack, making it (along with restart_block) a really
nice target.  This is fixed now on x86, arm64, and s390x, I believe,
and other arches can easily opt in to the fix.

* I'm strongly in favor of arches that have totally separate user and
kernel address spaces.  Sadly, the most common arches don't do this.
