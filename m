Hm, yes you're right. Specifically, it looks like strcspn() would also
be useful for this situation (i.e. calculate the length of a substring
that does not contain certain characters); combined with strncmp(),
this should make the string code much simpler, and no more buffer
allocating/freeing. :-)
