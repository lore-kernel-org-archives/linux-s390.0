Static analysis is just not going to cover all cases. We've had
vulnerabilities where interrupt handlers left KERNEL_DS set, for
example. If there are performance concerns, let's put this behind a
CONFIG. 2-5 instructions is not an issue for most people that want
this coverage.

This pattern was, in fact, what the interrupt handler bug escaped
from. We have to build proactive defenses, and this check has a clear
defensive advantage. It's a noble goal to improve the static analyzers
and simplify the source, but we have too much history to prove that
this just isn't enough. This instruction cost of this is extremely
small, too. Until we can eliminate set_fs(), we need to add this
check.

I'm not opposed to this, but there will be push-back on "making the
build slower", and it still won't catch everything. Bug-finding is
different from making a bug class just unexploitable at all. As we've
done before, it's the difference between trying to find format string
attacks vs just removing %n from the format parser.

Absolutely! But it's orthogonal to proactive runtime exploit blocking.
We've got one that works and defends against an entire class of
vulnerability for very low cost. It it's truly too costly for default,
let's put it behind a CONFIG and see who wants it. (Most distros, I
suspect, will enable it, just like hardened usercopy which is much
more expensive than this.)
