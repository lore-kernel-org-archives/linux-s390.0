Sure, sounds good.

Ah, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something..

Since copy_module_elf() is called after move_module(), my
understanding is that all the section sh_addr's should be pointing
to either module core memory or module init memory (instead of the
initial temporary copy of the module in info->hdr). Since the symbol
table section is marked with INIT_OFFSET_MASK, it will reside in
module init memory (and freed near the end of do_init_module()),
which is why I am updating the sh_addr here to point to core_symtab
instead. For livepatch modules, the core_symtab will be a complete
copy of the symbol table instead of the slimmed down version. Please
correct me if my understanding is incorrect.

Thanks for the patch review,
Jessica
