Yeah, I guess PF_ would be a bit more regular. Maybe we should even try to 
avoid the use of TS_ in x86, and turn it into PF_. There are probably bad 
historical reasons for the duplication of capabilities.

Let's see if it matters first. No reason to add another arch-specific 
thing if nobody can even measure this thing, and from a quick look it 
seems like every RESTORE_SIGMASK user is basically an error path for a 
system call. Those few extra cycles really won't be noticeable, we almost 
certainly have better things we could use our energy on.

So never mind. I think your series is fine, and my TS_ idea doesn't really 
look like it's worth it (and using PF_ sounds a bit more palatable since 
we could do it with existing infrastructure, but a quick grep shows that 
there's more users of test_thread_flag(TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK) than I would 
have expected (and the *testing* is equally cheap for atomic and thread- 
synchronous fields, so that's not a performance issue).
