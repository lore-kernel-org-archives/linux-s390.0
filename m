Looks like the config option is a no-op on parisc just like it is on
s390. Irrelavant of the config option at least on s390 the page tables for
kernel text and rodata will be read-only anyway.

This works since ages and I don't see a reason why this should be
changed. Also trying to disable this with the "rodata=" command line option
does not work at least on s390, and I guess this is true for parisc as
well.

The only thing implemented with CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA on both architectures
is to emit a message that states memory has been protected
(mark_rodata_ro).
This just avoids a wrong "Kernel memory protection disabled." message.

So yes, I'd really like to keep this option mandatory.
