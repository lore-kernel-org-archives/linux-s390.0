This patchset contains some minor cleanup, some preparatory work and
then the SCLP unit test itself.

The unit test checks the following:
    
    * Correctly ignoring instruction bits that should be ignored
    * Privileged instruction check
    * Check for addressing exceptions
    * Specification exceptions:
      - SCCB size less than 8
      - SCCB unaligned
      - SCCB overlaps prefix or lowcore
      - SCCB address higher than 2GB
    * Return codes for
      - Invalid command
      - SCCB too short (but at least 8)
      - SCCB page boundary violation

v3 -> v4
* export sclp_setup_int instead of copying it
* add more comments
* rename some more variables to improve readability
* improve the prefix test
* improved the invalid address test
* addressed further comments received during review
v2 -> v3
* generally improved the naming of variables
* added and fixed comments
* renamed test_one_run to test_one_simple
* added some const where needed
* addresed many more small comments received during review
v1 -> v2
* fix many small issues that came up during the first round of reviews
* add comments to each function
* use a static buffer for the SCCP template when used
