I was more generally thinking for io_remap_pfn_users because of the
mkwrite use-case we might have in fbdev emulation in drm.

Right auto-defering reopens the race, so making this work
automatically is a bit much. I guess just splitting this into a
setup/install part and then doing the install of all the ptes at first
fault should be good enough. We don't really need a new install_pages
for that, just an io_remap_pfn_range that's split in two parts.
