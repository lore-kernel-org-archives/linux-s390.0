Hi Andrew,

there are plans to support binary access.  Emanuele and I don't really
have a plan for how to implement it, but there are developers from
Google that have ideas (because Google has a similar "metricfs" thing
in-house).

I think atomic access would use some kind of "source_ops" struct
containing create_snapshot and release_snapshot function pointers.
