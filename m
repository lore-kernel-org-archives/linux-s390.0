This should be genericized to not be SEV specific.  TDX has a similar
scarcity issue in the form of key IDs, which IIUC are analogous to SEV ASIDs
(gave myself a quick crash course on SEV ASIDs).  Functionally, I doubt it
would change anything, I think it'd just be a bunch of renaming.  The hardest
part would probably be figuring out a name :-).

Another idea would be to go even more generic and implement a KVM cgroup
that accounts the number of VMs of a particular type, e.g. legacy, SEV,
SEV-ES?, and TDX.  That has potential future problems though as it falls
apart if hardware every supports 1:MANY VMs:KEYS, or if there is a need to
account keys outside of KVM, e.g. if MKTME for non-KVM cases ever sees the
light of day.
