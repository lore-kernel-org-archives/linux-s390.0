Yeah, for x86 it looks like st_other is used only for SHN_ABS symbols
in print_absolute_symbols(). Technically SHN_LIVEPATCH symbols
shouldn't be affected in this case...but despite its sparse usage in the
kernel it does look like using st_other to encode sympos is out of the
question as its meaning is architecture specific..

Sure, that should be doable. So the new process might look like this:

For every livepatch symbol referenced by a rela..

1) Save the sympos encoded in st_value

2) Save the sym_objname that is encoded in the symbol's name with the
'klp' suffix (Just to clarify: the sym_objname specifies the object
in which the symbol lives, and recall that we need this to remove the
need for the "external" flag)

3) Resolve the symbol by using its name (without the klp suffix),
sympos, and sym_objname

4) Set st_value to the found address

How about 'symname.klp.objname', and renaming the klp reloc sections
to '.klp.objname.rela.section_name'? Special symbol suffixes and
section names seem to always use '.', so maybe this would look better?
:-) But we can keep the underscores if people like that more. Both
naming methods would work, it is only a matter of preference.
