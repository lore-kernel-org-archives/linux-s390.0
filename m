And you *still* do the same.  Christoph, this is ridiculous - the worst
part of the area is not a couple of functions in fs/read_write.c, it's
a fucking lot of ->read() and ->write() instances in shitty driver code,
pardon the redundance.  And _that_ is still done under set_fs(KERNEL_DS).

Claiming that set_fs() done one function deeper in callchain (both in
fs/read_write.c) is somehow better because it reduces the amount of code
under that thing...  Get real, please - helpers that encapsulate those
set_fs() pairs (a-la kernel_read(), etc.) absolutely make sense and
converting their open-coded instances to calls of those helpers is clearly
a good thing.  However, we are not
	* getting rid of low-quality code run under KERNEL_DS
	* gettind rid of set_fs() itself
	* getting a generic kernel_read() variant that would really take
an iov_iter.

That's what I'm objecting to.  Centralized kernel_readv() et.al. - sure,
and fs/read_write.c is the right place for those.  No arguments here.
Conversion to those - absolutely; drivers have no fucking business touching
set_fs() at all.  But your primitives are trouble waiting to happen.
Let them take kvec arrays.  And let them, in case when there's no
->read_iter()/->write_iter(), do set_fs().  Statically, without this
if (iter->type & ITER_KVEC) ... stuff.

Yes.

vfs_llseek() used by ashmem_llseek()...
