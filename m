First of all, it is not obvious from the name osq_lock() that it is not 
an acquire barrier in some cases. We either need to clearly document it 
or has a variant name that indicate that, e.g. osq_lock_relaxed, for 
example.

Secondly, if we look at the use cases of osq_lock(), the additional 
latency (for non-x86 archs) only matters if the master lock is 
immediately available for acquisition after osq_lock() return. 
Otherwise, it will be hidden in the spinning loop for that master lock. 
So yes, there may be a slight performance hit in some cases, but 
certainly not always.

Yes, we can certainly do that like splitting into 2 variants, one with 
acquire barrier guarantee and one without.

Similar to osq_lock(), the current osq_unlock() does not have a release 
barrier guarantee. I think splitting into 2 variants - osq_unlock, 
osq_unlock_relaxed will help.
